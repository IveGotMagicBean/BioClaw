# BioClaw 🧬

**A personal AI-powered biology research assistant on WhatsApp.**

BioClaw brings bioinformatics tools to your fingertips — run BLAST searches, visualize protein structures with PyMOL, analyze genomic data, and search literature, all by messaging on WhatsApp. Designed for researchers who want quick access to computational biology workflows without switching to a terminal.

Built on [NanoClaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) + [STELLA](https://github.com/zaixizhang/STELLA) + Claude Agent SDK. Each conversation runs in an isolated Docker container pre-loaded with bioinformatics tools.

## Why BioClaw?

As a biology researcher, you often need to run quick analyses — check a sequence, look up a protein structure, or search for related papers. These tasks usually require SSH-ing into a server, setting up environments, and writing scripts. BioClaw lets you do all of this from a WhatsApp message, making computational biology accessible anywhere, anytime.

## Screenshots

**Protein structure rendering** — Load PDB 1UBQ (Ubiquitin) as a high-res rainbow cartoon:

**Hydrogen bond analysis** — Visualize hydrogen bonds between a ligand and protein in PDB 1M17:

**Binding site visualization** — Show residues within 5Å of ligand AQ4 in PDB 1M17:

**Structure alignment** — Align 1UBQ and 1UBI, colored cyan and magenta (RMSD = 0.101 Å):

## What It Does

Message `@Bioclaw` in a WhatsApp group and it can:

```
@Bioclaw BLAST this sequence against nr: ATGCGATCGATCG...
@Bioclaw analyze the FastQC report in my workspace
@Bioclaw find all ORFs in sequence.fasta and annotate them
@Bioclaw run differential expression analysis on counts.csv
@Bioclaw search PubMed for recent papers on CRISPR delivery methods
@Bioclaw align these reads to the human reference genome
@Bioclaw render the 3D structure of protein P53 from PDB and send me the image
@Bioclaw visualize gene expression heatmap from my RNA-seq data
```

The agent can also **send images** back — PyMOL protein renders, matplotlib plots, and more are delivered directly to the chat.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS or Linux
- Node.js 20+
- Docker Desktop
- An Anthropic API key

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Runchuan-BU/BioClaw.git
cd BioClaw
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
echo 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here' > .env
```

Build the Docker container (includes all bio tools):

```bash
docker build -t bioclaw-agent:latest container/
```

Authenticate with WhatsApp (one-time):

```bash
npx tsx src/whatsapp-auth.ts
```

Register a WhatsApp group for the bot to respond in:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/manage-groups.ts register
```

Start BioClaw:

```bash
npx tsx src/index.ts
```

### Group Management

```bash
npx tsx scripts/manage-groups.ts list        # Show registered groups
npx tsx scripts/manage-groups.ts available    # Show all discovered groups
npx tsx scripts/manage-groups.ts register     # Register a new group (interactive)
npx tsx scripts/manage-groups.ts remove <jid> # Remove a group
```

## How It Works

```
WhatsApp (@Bioclaw) → SQLite → Polling Loop → Docker Container (Claude + Bio Tools) → Response
                                                     ↓
                                              IPC (text + images) → WhatsApp
```

A single Node.js process orchestrates everything. When a message triggers the bot, it spins up an isolated Docker container with Claude and all bioinformatics tools pre-installed. The agent processes the request and sends results back — including rendered images — through an IPC file system.

Each group gets its own container, memory, and file storage. Groups are fully isolated from each other.

## Configuration

Default trigger word is `@Bioclaw`. Change it:

```bash
export ASSISTANT_NAME=MyLabBot
```

### Use Cases

- **Lab Group**: Mount your lab's shared sequencing data directory for collaborative analysis
- **Journal Club**: Schedule weekly PubMed searches for new papers in your field
- **Personal**: Private analysis workspace with full project access
